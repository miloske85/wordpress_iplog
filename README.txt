== Description ==

This is a simple Wordpress plugin designed to log access parameters (IP address, Referrer, User Agent) to database. This feature is nice to have when dealing with limited hosting plans which do not grant you access to server logs. It is not meant for use on busy site with thousands of visits every day because the database could grow out of control.

== Install ==

Just place the contents of this repository into wp-content/plugins/iplog (you'll need to create this folder) and activate the plugin from your WP control panel (Plugins->Installed Plugins).

== Requirements ==

* PHP 5.3+
* Wordpress 4+
