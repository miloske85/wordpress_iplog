== Description ==

This is a simple Wordpress plugin designed to log access parameters (IP address, Referrer, User Agent) to database. This feature is nice to have when dealing with limited hosting plans which do not grant you access to server logs. It is not meant for use on busy site with thousands of visits every day because the database could grow out of control.

== Requirements ==

* PHP 5.3+
* Wordpress 4+
